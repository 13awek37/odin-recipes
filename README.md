# **Slow Cooker Texas Pulled Pork**
## _This project is about building html document, which describes recipe of my favourite food_

The learning skills demonstrated here:

---
-  Building HTML boilerplate from scratch without using Emmet
*  Using heading element for recipe header
*  Incorporate relative link usage to the full ingredients of recipe
*  Adding unordered list by using <ul>
*  Adding ordered list by using <li>

## My own review:
I am very optimistic about The Odin Project because step by step it gives you important knowledge and builds up your confidence, so you don't feel overwhelmed early on.
